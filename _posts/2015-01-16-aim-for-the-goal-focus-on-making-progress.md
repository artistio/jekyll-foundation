One of the most powerful lesson that I learn in a Marathon is to focus on the moment. To focus in completing kilometers by kilometers, instead of focusing the 42.195 km. To put one foot ahead of the other

The distance of a Marathon is very heavy on my mind. The thought of finishing 42.195 km foot race will freeze you cold, or even the strongest mind in the world. It will be impossible for me to finish a Marathon if I think of the distance as a whole.

So, in each of my Marathon, I always break the distance into more manageable chunk. I used landmark if I know the area, such as Monas and Pancoran in Jakarta Marathon. In Penang Bridge Marathon, where landmark is practically minimal, I use the 10k and 21k turning point.

I think, the same way is also applicable in life. A big goal can be so daunting that it can paralyze our mind, and stop creative thinking. Finishing a huge 2 years project, for example. Or even selling multi million dollar deal, can be really heavy in our mind.

The goal will be more manageable if we break it into smaller chunk, and focus to complete the smaller chunk. A 2 years project can be broken down into stages of 6 months, which in turn broken down into monthly steps and target. Even if the monthly activities is too big, break it down into daily steps and target, or hourly.

And as you work it out, start completing those small chunks of steps. A marathon is completed one step at one time, and so does any other thing in life, one step at one time. And donâ€™t really think too much if you missed few small target. As long as at the end of the day you are making progress, you are already few steps closer in making it to your goal.
