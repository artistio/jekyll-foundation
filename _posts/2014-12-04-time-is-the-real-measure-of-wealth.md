If you still think the amount of money you have are the real measure of wealth, ask yourself this question: If you know that today will be your last day to live, how much money you are willing to spend to live with your loved one for another day? To see your kids grow up, graduate and getting married?

Most people will answer: Everything!

When it come to the amount of money a person can have, the sky is the limit. Each year we keep reading about the richest person in the world. And they seems to always grow in wealth. But, when it come to the amount of time a person will have, there are nobody that have unlimited time in this world. Some will die old, thus have longer time, while other will die young. But everyone will die eventually.

There are also another unique property of time: Time can’t be saved for later use. Everyone got 24 hours a day, whether it is used for good, or wasted. You can’t really say “Oh, I’m going to only use 22 hours today, so I can have 26 hours a day tomorrow”.

People will usually say that they are saving time when they are doing their task faster. But it is a quite different concept when compared to money. People save money so it can be used for later date. But when it come to time, when people say that they are saving time, it is simply that they can do some other things earlier, not using the saved time for later use.

The affluent seems to understand this. If you come to their home, look how many people are working around their home. The cleaner, gardener, and maid, all is being paid so that the owner can have their time to do something else. So they pay people’s time to do task that can be delegated.

And when they travel on business class, or staying in expensive hotel, or drinking a good wine, they would say: “Having a good time.” Yes, they want to enjoy the particular moment.

So, next time you decide to do something, think about it: is it the best way to spend your time?
