An interesting discussion with my wife this mourning about this topic was started by a cue from radio: What action do you do, as parent, in relation to your kids using social media?

“Our friend’s kid is using Instagram. I think it trained him to learn to see different angle for photography”, said my wife.

“True, but the parents need to actively participate in helping him learn, to see new angle”. I said “In fact, it is not only in Social Media. In any other things, parent need to invest their time to participate, may it be a lego, bicycle, or swimming”

The more I think about it, the phenomena that younger kids start to use social media and smart phone is nothing unusual. It is similar like kids playing Lego, crayon, watching TV, or playing bicycle. The Social Media will become a problem, if parents use it as replacement for nanny-ing their kids. In other words, parents pass the social media and smart phone to distract their kids so that they can do something else.

Like any other in young kid’s life, it will require active participation from parents. Lego is good to help kids solve problem, visualize shapes and improve fine motor skills. But without adult play with them, the Lego might end up in their mouth, or missing somewhere under the fridge or table. An adult need to be with them to tell them the great thing you can do with Lego bricks.

Same thing with crayon. That little was full of color might end up on your wall, or even worse, in your kid’s stomach. We need to play with them, tell them the fun great thing that they can do with it. It is no different that ipad. We need to invest our time in it.

So, ipad or not, smart phone or not, invest your time with your kids. Most thing that you do can probably wait.
