Steve Jobs had the vision of “Computer for the rest of us” when he started Apple Computer. He sold his car, and put his future into creating Apple II computer, and later Machintosh. When he was ousted from Apple, again, living his vision, he started NeXT to create computer for everyone. And when he was back with Apple, he live and breathe to another of his passion: design.

Not only that. All other Apple product after his return, the design of Apple store, live and breathe his passion, his vision.

Tony Fernandez, once a Regional VP of Warner Music Group for Southeast Asia, has a comfortable paycheck and bonus to live lavishly. Yet, he quit his job, and bought AirAsia, a troubled company back then, with his own money, and by mortgaging his home. He then transformed AirAsia into the most respected low cost carrier in the region. He live and breathe his dream: to run an airlines.

So, what differentiate someone who is passionate, and someone who is visionary?

Quoting a friend of mine over lunch: A true visionary believe in his/her vision. Their vision is more than passion, it is their religion. If given between death and not achieving his/her vision, a true visionary will choose death. It is the only thing they believe, live and breathe for.

So, do you define yourself a true visionary?
