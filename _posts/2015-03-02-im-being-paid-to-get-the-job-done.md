In my my professional life, Iâ€™m being paid to get my job done. And I guess, a lot of us here that get paid to get a job done.

If you have the same understanding, things will start to look different. You will start to see other things as merely tools to get the job done. The tools can be in form of courtesy, money, or anything else that is tangible or abstract. When the tools stop working, you find another tools to help you get the job done.

Sometimes people mix between professional and personal relationship. They afraid to make too much noise, or to escalate things until it is too late, in order to maintain relationship with someone. But if you do it strictly for professional reason, fact-based, and not badmouthing that person, you might do him a favor.

And after that, you can still have a good cup of coffee, or glass of beer to maintain that personal relationship.

Remember, you are being paid to get the job done.
