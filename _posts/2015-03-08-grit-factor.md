We all know that Intelligent Quotient is not the main determining factor of success. I also think that Emotional Quotient is not the main determining factor of success. Otherwise, bad temper people like Steve Jobs wold never make it.

Lately, the mantra of success is to do what you love. To find your passion, never settle until you found one. However, after listening to the TED talk below, I believe that passion is not the main determining factor as well. Not all people who do their passion will be guaranteed a success.

There are another factor, a more determining one that almost guarantee a success, that every successful person have in common. It is called Grit. Wikipedia has a description of Grit, but I like Angela Duckworth’s description about Grit in his talk:

> Grit is passion and perseverance for very long-term goals. Grit is having stamina. Grit is sticking with your future, day in, day out, not just for the week, not just for the month, but for years, and working really hardto make that future a reality. Grit is living life like it’s a marathon, not a sprint.

For me, Grit is combination of motivation, perseverance and faith combined into one. It is a motivation to grow, to get the job done, or to achieve goals. It is to persevere when things get rough, and it is faith that, someday int he longer term, things will get better. And anyone can have Grit, with high IQ or not, or doing their passion or something else.

Sure passion and high IQ will help, but without motivation, perseverance and faith, it is impossible to achieve your true potential.
