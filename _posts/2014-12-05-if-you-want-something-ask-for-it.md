Steve Jobs probably put it the best when it come to asking for something. At the age of 12, he called Bill Hewlett, the founder and CEO of Hewlett-Packard back then. He basically need some help to get some spare parts, and ask it to a CEO of a big company. How many people have the gut to call up the CEO of a big company, asking for help?

Another good teacher of this is my 3 years old son. I realize that, in our childhood, we always ask anything that we want. My son always ask for everything, like wanting to swim, want to eat this or that, want to play with his firetruck or windmill, and many more. Somehow, as we grow up, we lose the ability to ask for something.

So, in retrospect, here are what I’ve been doing in the last couple of months:

1. I make sure to ask if I need some help, need information, food, or any stuff
2. Most people will help, but some will say no. In this case, if I want it hard enough, I’ll find someone else who cares and willing to help
3. Sometimes you also need to self-retrospect, or change the way you convey the message. But in any case, if you want something bad enough, never stop to ask and push thing forward
4. And stop complaining. If you can’t find the energy to keep asking and pushing forward, maybe you don’t want that stuff bad enough. Complaining didn’t get things moving.
