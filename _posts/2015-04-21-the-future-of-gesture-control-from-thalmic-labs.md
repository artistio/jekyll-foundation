All Iâ€™m looking for is a better way to control my presentation. What I found is more than I expect. It is definitely the future.

Over lunch today, we discussed on what will be the future of interaction between human and computer. In the early days, and until today, human interact with computer via keyboard. Then mouse come into existence. Steve Jobs and Apple demonstrate that it is possible to interact with computer without using keyboard and mouse, but using touch interface.

Back to our lunch, all of us agree that the future human-computer interface will be a 3D interface. If you have watched the movie Minority Report in 2002, we think of similar interface used by Tom Cruise to manipulate PreCrime computer.

The system is yet to exist, but these guys from [Thalmic Labs](https://www.thalmic.com/) has made it one step closer. Check out their TEDx Video below, where they explain how the system works, and demonstrate to control a flying drone. What is missing from it is visualization system to visualize the surrounding of the drone. And then, someday, who knows that the same system can be used to fly and control an aircraft?
