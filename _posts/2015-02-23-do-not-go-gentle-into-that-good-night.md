> Do not go gentle into that good night,
> Old age should burn and rave at close of day;
> Rage, rage against the dying of the light.
>  – Dylan Thomas, 1914 – 1953

If you have watched the movie Interstellar, the line above from Dylan Thomas’ poem is recited a couple of time. The full poem has a deep meaning, originally written by Dylan for his dying father.

For me, the lines mean that, no matter how dire a situation that you are in, don’t lose hope. Rage, keep the fire burning inside you. Give your best shot, produce your best quality of work. Do not go gentle, half-hearted, no matter how hopeless thing seems to be.
