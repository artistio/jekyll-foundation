The business world is measured by profitability, on positive cash flow, on how much money can you create for your shareholder. It is no wonder that all of our goals, whether as business owner, executive, or employee, are around increasing sales, and keeping cost manageable.

But one should not forget that, at least for sometime in the future, business is operated by human. Human do get old, get sick, unreliable and need to be replaced. Therefore, it is important that in addition to increasing sales and managing cost, a company should also grow the people within and society around it, in order for achieving sustainable growth.

This time I would like to share a story about growing the employee.

During one project assignment, I was given a fresh graduate to assist me getting the job done. Someone right out of the university gate, one of the best in the country, and the best raw material that you can get. As I worked with him more, I see a lot of potential in him.

So, I start to put more work on his shoulder, while at the same time handhold him to make sure he didn't trip. Guiding him page by page on how to come out with nice slides, asking him to meet customer, first from staff level, then middle management and finally an executive. I shared some of the company's philosophy, and my own that you can also find in this blog. And of course, make sure that he is visible in our own management team, that his work is known by customer, and our management.

Unfortunately, I didn't get to see him promoted. Due to family reason, I decided to take another job closer to home with bigger flexibility. My parting message to him was: "Stay in this company, and aim for your promotion. You are on the right track." And apparently I did touch something on him that, he also gave me a parting gift.

Yesterday, I heard the news: He earned his promotion this year. He was happy, I was ecstatic. 

He did earn the promotion based on his hard work. As for my role, I just gave him the chance, trust and mentored him to grow. I just put water and fertilizer on a good bean to grow a great tree.

So, have you seen some good talent in you team that is willing to put the hard work, step up the responsibility, and learn new things? Have you grow them today, by giving your trust, a chance to shine, and guidance for the next level?
