Heaven and Hell decide to build a bridge to connect both world, so that they can communicate easily. After some discussion, it is decided that both side will build their half part of the bridge, and meet in the middle.

So, Hell started to gather their resources and build its half part of the bridge. After some time, Hell’s builder reached the middle point. But, the Heaven’s builders are nowhere in sight.

So, Hell’s builder yelled to Heaven: “Hey, we are already at the middle point. Where are you guys?”

“Ummm, we havent’t started”, replied Heaven

“WHATTTTTTT? Why? What happen?”, Hell obviously furious.

“We can’t find any project manager here”, replied Heaven

Moral of the story:

* You still need to work in heaven or hell to make things happen
* All project manager go to hell. But, they make things happen. This kind of people that we need in the world, to make things happen
