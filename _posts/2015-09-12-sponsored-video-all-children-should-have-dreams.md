The video below is sponsored by [The Global Goals](http://www.globalgoals.org/). It is the latest movement by the United Nations, which aims to End extreme poverty, Fight inequality & injustice, Fix climate change, in all countries, for all people.

Why is it matter to me? Because, I have a kid. My son, just like Mekfah, the poor Thai boy in the video below has a dream. A dream, which a better world can help to create. A better world that The Global Goals tried to shape.

It is the world that I would like to create to help my son and other kids's dream come true. And for my own dream too. There are no reason why we need to stop dreaming once we become an adult, right?
