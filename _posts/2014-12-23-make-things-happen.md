I believe that, as part of the society, citizen or whoever we are, we should strive to make things happen. That also means support to make things happen, or at least not attempting to hinder it, even if it seems that we got nothing in returns. The only question to ask is: does it help to make the society better? If the answer is yes, then we should not hinder things to happen.

The problem is, it seems today that many people stop things to happen, eventhough that it is for greater good. The reason is simple: the thing didn’t bring any direct reward for them. The thing didn’t bring money, position, recognition or fame to them.

I think it is fair for people to work for reward: money, position, recognition or fame. So, I think, if someone doesn’t want to invest their energy, time or money for nothing, at least don’t stop thing to happen. Especially if it is for greater good.

The worst thing that someone can do is to spend their time, money and energy to stop something to happen, especially if that something is for a cause, for a greater good.
