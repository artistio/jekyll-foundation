> It is consistency and perseverance that will move a mountain – Rich Roll, in an podcast with James “Iron Cowbow” Lawrence.

The statement above caught my attention as I listened to Rich Roll Podcast in my morning commute. It touch me deeply to think that, almost anything is possible if you have the consistency and perseverance.

Consistency means doing the same thing over and over again, day in day out, with a believe that it will lead to improvement, or to your goal. If you watched Karate Kid, it is the Wax On Wax Off moment. In athletic performance, it means running the same course, same speed, same volume, in believe that it will lead to improvement. In investment world, it means buying the stock as the indicator say so. It is boring, yet you do it day in day out, knowing that it will lead to your goals.

Perseverance means doing things when situation is not in your favor. It could means keep running despite heavy rain, or pushing your training time in the middle of busy week. It could also means to keep producing high quality work, even when nobody believe in you.

If you have both, you can surely move a mountain.
