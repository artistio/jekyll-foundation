I often heard from people: “I’m not into the job as salesman”, or “sales job is not my passion”. Well, the fact that, I also feel the same. I never feel that I’m good in selling, and never really sell anything during my school year. But one day I realize that, at the end of the day, everyone has to sell something.

Don’t believe me? Think of when you go for a job interview, including interview for non-sales job. Did you tell your prospective employer of what are you good at? Did you wish that the person on the other side of the table to be impressed with your skills and experience? Did you do that so that your future employer will offer good position with good pay? In other words, are you trying to sell your skill, and your time, to your future employer for a good price (paycheck)?

Many people struggles in getting a job interview, because they write a CV that didn’t sell. Think of CV as your brochure, similar like the brochure that you get when you are walking in a shopping mall. If the brochure is not interesting, are you going to keep it and pay the shop a visit? If your CV is not interesting and well crafted, employer will also not keep it and give yourself a chance for interview.

And it doesn’t stop when you get the job. The sales skills are also required when you write your self review of annual performance result, as what currently being practiced by many company. I have a hands on experience in this matter. Earlier in my career back in 2002, I practiced what I learn in CV writing into writing my performance result. The outcome? I got higher salary increase compared to my colleague, who was doing the same job, and at the same level.

No matter how hard you work, or how brilliant your idea is, all going to be useless if you can’t convey it to the world. You need to be able to get the idea out, to tell and convince people that you are doing a great job, that you worth higher pay or money. And the best way to do that is by mastering the art of selling.

So, even if you never dream to become entrepreneur, or building a career as sales, do yourself a favor and learn few things on what make a good sales. At least, do yourself a favor by learning how to sell yourself, by writing a good CV, and to verbally sell yourself during a job interview. It will help you in the long run.
