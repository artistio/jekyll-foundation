If you made an appointment at 10am, it means you need to show up at 10:00, not 10:15 or 10:30. 10:05 can still be tolerated as people sometime unintentionally set their clock 5 minute late. But definitely not 30 minutes late.

Make all effort to attend meeting or appointment in time. Leave early and aim to arrive 15-30 minutes in advance. Wait at nearby coffee shop within walking distance of your meeting, rather than somewhere that risk you to be caught in the traffic jam. By being in time, you show respect to other people time, and the higher importance you put to the meeting or the person you are going to meet. All these little things will bring you a long way forward.

You have made every effort to show up in time for your flight. Why not trying to do the same with your other appointment? Besides, I donâ€™t ask you to be there 2 hours before, only 15 minutes before.
