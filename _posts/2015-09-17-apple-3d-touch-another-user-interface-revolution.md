Bill Gates predicted back in [D5 conference in 2007](http://allthingsd.com/20070531/d5-gates-jobs-transcript/) that 3D will come to user interface. Back then, we all was thinking of something like what Tom Cruise use in the film Minority Report, and what the people from [Thalmic Labs has able to produce](http://benny.id/blog/the-future-of-gesture-control-from-thalmic-labs.html)

But the latest announcement from Apple about the new 3D touch blew my mind. It is basically an additional layer in iPhone 6S that allow the device to sense how hard you push the screen, and pass the information to application to be processed and responded.

Many people think that this is similar to Android's long press capability that has been there for some time. Another Apple copying someone else. Well, it is Apple's bad in the demonstration. With the support of additional hardware in iPhone 6, the 3D touch can do much more than Android's long press, something that is missing from the demo.

Think of the use of pressure-sensitive user interface for these things:
1. For painters, who used to apply different pressure to create different line thickness. This will also apply to those who write Japanese and Chinese.
2. Pianist, who use different stroke power to create variation in a play. This will be mainly for people who learn to play piano

Not to mention game makers, who are sure to fund better way to play games. The possibility is limitless.

Again, Apple revolutionize the industry, this time in the area of user interface. I wished Apple to do better in their marketing campaign to separate themself from competitors.
