Here is a few things to ponder. If Leonardo Da Vinci never put the painting of Mona Lisa out in the public, do you think the painting will become “the best known, the most visited, the most written about, the most sung about, the most parodied work of art in the world”?

If The Wachowski Brothers never put the film Matrix out for public view, do you think they will be as famous as they are today? If Mark Zuckerberg never open Facebook for public, do you think he will be as rich and famous as he is today?

You can plan forever, design for several iteration, do a build test, pilot run, and many more before your big launch. But, no matter how great your work is in whatever you are doing, a web designer designing a blog, an architect designing a house, a programmer writing a code for a games, a project manager doing transformation project, your work will never become an art until out into public. Unless you pack your final product and ship it out.

Putting your work out in the public means that making the connection between you, the artist, and the general public. It means that your product will influence and change the public in a way. It means, to be ready to be criticized by the public, and to fail. It also means to use the critics and lesson learn for the next iteration to make a better product.
