If you never worry about education, now it is time to worry. The business environment is changing, from industrialization to creative economy. But, has our education adapt to the changes? Watch Sir Ken Robinson’s TED Talk in February 2006 below. If you simply in a hurry, skip to after the video, and return later to watch the video. Seriously, Sir Ken Robinson’s talk is hilarious.

I specifically interested on Sir Ken Robinson’s view on education at around 11 minutes into the talk. This is what he said:

> “…. The whole (education) system was invented — around the world, there were no public systems of education, really, before the 19th century. They all came into being to meet the needs of industrialism……”

When you think about it, it is quite true. Look on our education today. How are we trying to churn out people with same skill, with the same measurement, namely Grade Point Average. And, in addition to that, how we stigmatized art and social science at lower caste than exact science?

For me, it is no different than how industrialized economy operates to standardize everything. This is how it supposed to work in industrialized economy. In order to produce product with certain standard of quality, you need to employ people with certain standard. This is what our current education system do: to produce graduates with certain quality standard. Anything different from standard will be stigmatized as “below” standard.

This education system, and its output will not survive in creative economy. Workers in creative economy will need to think out of the box. They need to think different from the current standard, to get out of the competition, and create new things. They need to go to uncharted territory, take a chance, and not afraid of being wrong, or risking themselves caught in the fierce competition of industrialized economy.

But sadly, as what Sir Ken Robinson mention earlier, the current education system frown upon those who make mistake, who thinking of other way to do things. This need to change.

So, coming back to ourself, how do we want to raise our son? This is the mental note that we made: We don’t put a high demand on good academy result from our son. We want him to not afraid to take a chance, even if he don’t know or not sure, and not afraid to make mistake
